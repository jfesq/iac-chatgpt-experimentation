## Infrastructure-as-Code Experiment

### Question topic
As a developer who is learning about cloud offerings, does using ChatGPT and/or other AI tooling improve my understanding and/or efficiency by helping to generate cloud template files (CloudFormation/Bicep/Terraform etc) i.e., infrastructure-as-code (IaC)?

### Intended outcomes
How useful are AI tools when learning to create infrastructure? Given the complexity of options when generating IaC (for example, required and non-required parameters, template syntax, template formats, the relationships between infra resources etc.), we can use Udemy or Pluralsite courses that provide tutorials and IaC templates to measure the accuracy of the output. 

Starting with a Chat-GPT-genereated template should move the starting point of learning forward and break the curse of the blank page, even if there are mistakes in the generated code. 


### Learning Labs/Tasks
- Setting up a network in Azure: [Network setup prompt](azure-networks/basic-network.md)

- Translating the above network setup result from Bicep to Terraform [Translate to Terraform](azure-networks/translate-to-tf.md)

- Creating a virtual machine in Azure: [VM creation prompt](azure-vms/basic-vm.md)
