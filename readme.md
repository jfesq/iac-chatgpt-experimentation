## Infrastructure-as-Code Experiment

### Question topic
As a developer who is learning about cloud offerings, does using ChatGPT and/or other AI tooling improves my efficiency by helping to generate cloud template files (CloudFormation/Bicep/Terraform etc) i.e., infrastructure-as-code (IaC)?

### Intended outcomes
How useful are AI tools when learning to create infrastructure? Given the complexity of options when generating IaC (for example, required and non-required parameters, template syntax, template formats, the relationships between infra resources etc.), we can use Udemy or Pluralsite courses that provide tutorials and IaC templates to measure the accuracy of the output.
